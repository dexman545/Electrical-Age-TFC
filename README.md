[Official Minecraft forum post](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/2741783-172forge-electrical-age-mod-beta-146/) (updated frequently).

### How to get started

Download [the last version of the mod](https://github.com/Dolu1990/ElectricalAge/archive/1.7.2-MNA-gradle.zip) and then run `unzipTutoMap` and `runClient` tasks to start playing on the [tutorial map](https://github.com/Dolu1990/ElectricalAge/releases/download/BETA-1.9/ElectricalAge_tutorialMap_BETA-1.9_r41.zip).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Dolu1990/ElectricalAge.git
cd ElectricalAge
gradle unzipTutoMap runClient
```

## ABOUT
[ELN](http://electrical-age.net/) is a Minecraft Mod offering the ability to perform large-scale, in-game electrical simulations. Here is some highlighted features:

A better simulation
> Electrical simulation with resistive and capacitive effects. Behaviour similar to those of real life objects.
	
Multiple electrical machines and components
> Furnaces, Solar panels, Wind turbines, Batteries, Capacitors, ...
	
Break the cube
> Cables, sensors, actuators, alarms, etc. can be placed on each face (outer and inner) of a cube, which allows a significant reduction of the consumed space by electrical installations.
	
Night-lighting revisited
> Lamps, switches, captors, ...
	
Small and big electrical consumers
> From lamps and electrical furnaces to miners and transporters...

Incredible tools
> XRay scanner, flashlight, portable mining drill...

Interoperability
> Old redstone circuits can be exploited with electrical <-> redstone converters.
	
Game lifetime/complexity extended
> A consequent list of new raw materials and items...

## CURRENT STATE
**Beta**. There will be bugs :exclamation:
Additional objects and enhancements are likely.
